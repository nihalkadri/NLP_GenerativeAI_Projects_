**Emotion Classification using RoBERTa and XLNet**

- This project leverages advanced transformer models, specifically RoBERTa and XLNet, to classify emotions in Twitter messages. The aim is to provide businesses with insights for sentiment analysis, social media monitoring, and improving customer experience.

RoBERTa, a "Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach," and XLNet, known for its "Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding," are explored for their architectures, training methodologies, and optimization techniques. The project implements these pre-trained models to effectively categorize human emotions.

Overall, this project showcases the capabilities of RoBERTa and XLNet in text classification tasks, demonstrating their potential to enhance social media engagement and customer sentiment analysis.
